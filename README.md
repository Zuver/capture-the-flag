The purpose of this project is to learn game development without relying on powerful game engines to do all the heavy lifting. I'm using C# and limiting myself to the latest MonoGame framework and the latest .NET framework. Since I am building the game engine myself, this will be a slower-moving project. But speed is not the key here. Learning how to make a game from "scratch" is what I am hoping to get better at. Feel free to have a look around the source code and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
