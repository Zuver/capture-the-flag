This is a simple top-down shooter game written in C#.

These are the frameworks I am using:
- MonoGame 3.8.0.1641 (released August 10th, 2020)
- .NET 4.7.2 (released April 30th, 2018)

To make it more of a challenge, I am not using a game "engine" for this project. So all the physics and AI was written by me.

I'm not sure what my ultimate goal is with this project, but I'd like to be able to play it on my Raspberry Pi. So eventually, a migration to .NET Core will have to happen.
